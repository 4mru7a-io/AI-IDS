# 🔐 AI_IDS — AI-Based Intrusion Detection System

AI_IDS is an "Artificial Intelligence–based Intrusion Detection System" designed to detect malicious activities in network traffic using "Machine Learning techniques".  
The system not only classifies traffic as "normal or attack", but also "identifies the type of attack", making it more informative and useful for cybersecurity analysis.

 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

With the rapid growth of internet usage, traditional rule-based security systems are no longer sufficient to detect modern and evolving cyber attacks.  
"AI_IDS" uses machine learning models to analyze network traffic patterns and intelligently detect intrusions along with their "attack categories".

---

 🎯 OBJECTIVES

- Detect network intrusions using AI/ML techniques  
- Classify traffic as "normal or malicious"  
- Identify the "type of attack" (for malicious traffic)  
- Improve detection accuracy compared to traditional IDS  
- Provide an intelligent and scalable cybersecurity solution

 ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

1. Network traffic data is collected  
2. Data preprocessing and feature extraction is performed  
3. Machine learning models are trained on labeled data  
4. The system predicts:
   - Whether the traffic is "Normal or Attack"
   - If an attack is detected, the "type of attack"
5. Results are evaluated using accuracy and visual analysis  

---

 🚨 ATTACK CLASSIFICATION

For malicious traffic, the system can identify different "types of attacks", such as:

- Denial of Service (DoS)  
- Probe / Scanning attacks  
- Remote to Local (R2L) attacks  
- User to Root (U2R) attacks  

This multi-class classification helps in understanding "what kind of threat" is present, not just whether an intrusion occurred.

---

 📊 RESULTS

- Successfully classified traffic as "normal or malicious"  
- Accurately identified different "attack categories"  
- Visualized traffic patterns and attack distributions  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in intrusion detection  

(Performance may vary based on dataset and algorithm used)
